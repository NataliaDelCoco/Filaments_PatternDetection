# Filaments_PatternDetection
1)
Scripts necessaries to execute the Cosmic Web Reconstrucion code (Chen et al. 2015).
The scripst are in C++. The main one is in Python ("pattern_detection.py"), that connects all the others. 
IMPORTANT: Pyhton code runs CWR in parallel. Not to use more then 4 cores if RAM < 1TB.

2) IMAGE2.py
Uses the Multiscale Morphology Filter method to find patterns of blobs and filaments in a distribution of points.
